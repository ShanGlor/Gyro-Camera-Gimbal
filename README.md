# GyroCam2

A 2-axis servo-based gimbal for pitch and roll using MPU-6050 as sensor

MPU-6050 connected to I2c pins (A4 and A5) SDA and SCL respectively.

Pitch servo to D10 and Roll servo to D11.

Servos and MPU use 5 volts from Arduino and common ground.

NOTE: You can adjust the resting servo angle from the sketch.

TODO: Adding pots for servo calibration.
